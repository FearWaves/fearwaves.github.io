 <p>FearWaves always had a thing with music and liked beat boxing. He also started making music once he found the music artist BoyWithUke, BoyWithUke was a huge impact on his life and made him want to make music. FearWaves made music with GarageBand and made his lyrics inside Apple Note. His first song, Just Got To Say, was made with these materials. The instruments used to make the song were Modern 808, Erhu, and Epic Cloud Formation synth keyboard. He posted his first song on Youtube and later on SoundCloud. He posted all of his songs to youtube and SounCloud with his most recent song being Shooting Star as of November, 2022. He gets his support from two of his friends to keep on making music. He is hoping to make a hit song soon to make fun of everybody who said that he couldn't be a good music artist. That is all FearWaves is willing to share to the world, he would moost likely update this passage and include more information about his life.
